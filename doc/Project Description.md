# Project Proposal

## 1. Project Title

Evaluation of Airlines Tool 2015 (EAT 2015)

## 2. Project Summary:  It should be a 1-2 paragraph description of what your project is.

Evaluation of Airlines Tool 2015 (EAT 2015) is the user's go to choice for selecting their flights, especially if they hate delays. EAT will rank the Airlines in terms of flight delay or cancellation, specifically with reference to user-selected variables like the day of the week, Departure airport or layover preference. 

EAT will also provide data visualization tools that allows consumers or even researchers to easily view the data through customizable scopes and sliders.

## 3. Description of an application of your choice. State as clearly as possible what you want to do. What problem do you want to solve, etc.?

A user may have tightly packed back-to-back flights with a layover, and there is a chance that the first flight being delayed may cause the user to miss the second flight.

With EAT 2015, the user will be able to filter out airlines that are notorious for flight delays or cancellations, so that they will feel secure in their choice for the first flight.

## 4. Usefulness. Explain as clearly as possible why your chosen application is useful.  Make sure to answer the following questions: Are there any similar websites/applications out there?  If so, what are they, and how is yours different?

EAT 2015 caters to a niche group of people who place importance on avoiding flight delays, which may be because of a tightly packed second flight following a first flight, where a delay would cause them to miss their second flight. EAT 2015's data could serve as a reference point for future consumers.

Google Flights or SkyScanner give the best rankings for price and timings, but they fail to account for flight delays, which might be important for people having short layovers. We hope that the data in 2015 could provide context for which flight delays are likely in the future.

## 5. Realness.  Describe what your data is and where you will get it.

The data is from the U.S. Department of Transport Bureau of Transportation Statistics. The data is from 2015. It records all flight delays and cancellations in the United States. 

This dataset also provides other attributes like Day of the Week, Flight number, Destination / Departure Airport, Scheduled Departure time, Airport Longitude / Latitude etc.

The data is retireved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays.

## 6. Description of the functionality that your website offers. This is where you talk about what the website delivers. Talk about how a user would interact with the application (i.e., things that one could create, delete, update, or search for). Read the requirements for stage 4 to see what other functionalities you want to provide to the users. You should include:

One of the major functions would be ranking the Airlines in terms of flight delay or cancellation, specifically with reference to user-selected variables like the day of the week, Departure airport or layover preference.

Another function would be data visualization where we present the flight data for the user to view without ranking the data. This would be best presented in the form of graphs and infographics.

We could include an interactive map that allows the user to look up the airport and visualize the path that the user is taking after they select the best ranked path.

This would be done by integrating map APIs like the Google Maps Platform, alongside the data that we gave. 

The user could go onto the website and give a few preference for their flight. For example, the flight time, departure airport, and layover location. 

The user can tweak sliders or interact with our interactive map to visualize the flight paths of all of their chosen flights.

## Explain how backend systems will be distributed across members. Be as specific as possible as this could be part of the final peer evaluation metrics.

We will be having weekly meetings where we split the work evenly between the team members. We will have a date where we will git push our updates and then we will have a system where other members would review the updates and then finally integrate it to the final working code.
